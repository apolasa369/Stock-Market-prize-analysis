# Data Preparation:  
The code begins by loading the historical stock price data for multiple companies. It processes the data and creates a list of features for each company, where each feature is a sequence of historical stock prices. These features are then converted into input sequences (X) and target values (y) for training. The input sequences are created by splitting the historical stock price data into multiple time steps, and the target values are the next-day stock prices. 
# LSTM Model Creation and Training:  
For each company, the code creates a separate LSTM model using the create_lstm_model function. This LSTM model is designed to learn patterns in sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting tasks. The model is then trained using the historical stock price data of the respective company. The training process aims to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted stock prices and the actual stock prices. The model is trained for a fixed number of epochs, and the training progress is not displayed (verbose=0) to avoid unnecessary output. 
# Prediction and Inverse Scaling:  
After training each LSTM model, it uses the test data (historical stock prices not seen during training) for each company to make predictions of future stock prices. The predicted stock prices are then inverse-scaled using the MinMaxScaler to bring them back to their original scale, as they were normalized during preprocessing. Plotting Predictions:  Finally, the code plots the predicted stock prices against the actual stock prices on the test set for each company. The blue line represents the actual stock prices, and the red line represents the predicted stock prices.

### Note:

The code assumes that X_train_dict, y_train_dict, X_test_dict, and y_test_dict are dictionaries containing the training and test data for each company, respectively.
For each company, the input shape of the LSTM model is determined based on the number of time steps and features in the training data.
If the LSTM models show a straight line for predicted values, it could indicate that the model is not effectively capturing the patterns in the data. In such cases, trying different hyperparameters or exploring other models like CNNs could be helpful.
If you plan to use this code on GitHub, it is essential to include the necessary data preprocessing steps and ensure that you have appropriate training and test datasets available for multiple companies. Additionally, you may want to add comments to the code to make it more understandable for other users or potential collaborators.
